A small collection of little scripts I wrote to enhance my i3 workflow

i3float:
requires: xdotool, slop
draw a rectangle on your screen and i3 will float a window and size/position it onto that rectangle

floatnext.py
simple "new window" event listener that tells i3 to float the new window (script exits on first occurance of this, so only floats the next window)


more to come, I made this repo at midnight out of boredom and am too tired to scrounge my configs rn.
